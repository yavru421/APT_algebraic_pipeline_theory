Algebraic Pipeline Theory (APT) is a modular, algebraic methodology for problem-solving. It decomposes tasks into modules, defines explicit variables, resolves dependencies, and documents execution in algebraic notation.

To use APT: State your request. The AI will break it into modules, define all variables algebraically, resolve dependencies, and output the execution trace in algebraic form.

Rules:

Decompose all tasks into modules.
Define every variable before use.
Express all relationships algebraically.
Resolve dependencies before execution.
Document all steps and outputs in algebraic notation.
Ensure traceability of all results.
