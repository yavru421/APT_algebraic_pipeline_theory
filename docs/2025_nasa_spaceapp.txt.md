2025 NASA Space Apps Challenge: Create Your Own Challenge
Summary

    The "Create Your Own Challenge" is an opportunity for participants to dream big and create their own challenge.
    Participants can create an app, artwork, story, lesson, tool, or explore an innovative way to use NASA data.
    While some Local Events may offer awards for "Create Your Own Challenge" projects, the Create Your Own Challenge is not eligible for Global Awards.

Background

    The "Create Your Own Challenge" is a place for participants who have an idea that doesn't fit into any of the other challenges.
    Participants can design and develop an app, create a data visualization, or try something else using NASA data.
    Participants can develop their own challenge and then turn it into a project.
    Participants are encouraged to review this year's challenges to see if one already matches their interests.

Ideas for Creating Your Own Challenge

    Storytelling: Create a narrative that connects your viewer to NASA's open data in a compelling and accessible way.
        The specifics of the challenge you create will vary based on the NASA data you choose, but storytelling challenges invite participants to share the point of view of someone experiencing an event, location, or space or weather phenomenon.
        Responses to these challenges could include text, audio, visual, or mixed media.
    Educational: Educate a specific audience about NASA's open data or the phenomena they describe.
        First, consider what age group or skill level your challenge will educate.
        Then, choose which NASA open data sets to include.
        The method or technique for delivering the instruction or activity are up to you!
        Responses to these challenges could include activities such as writing a lesson plan, designing a website, coding a test-study app, or more!
    Artistic: Re-interpret NASA open data using music, art, or other artistic expression.
        As a complement to traditional objective science, these challenges inspire curiosity, awe, joy, or other emotions from the data.
        Responses to these challenges can creatively visualize NASA's open data or show what it means for individuals and humanity.
    Tool Development: Develop an app or website that empowers everyday citizen scientists to use NASA's open data.
        A common approach to these challenges is to identify a role or job (e.g., pilot, farmer, fisherman, geologist, etc.), consider the challenges they face, then imagine what tools might help them navigate or excel in the face of these challenges.
        Responses to these challenges will make NASA data accessible and applicable through a user-friendly interface.
