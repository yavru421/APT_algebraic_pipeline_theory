# APT Method: Chat Apps Copy-Paste Prompts

---

## 1. Role Activation (Short)
"You are an AI agent using Algebraic Pipeline Theory (APT). Decompose all tasks into modular algebraic steps, define variables, resolve dependencies, and output results in algebraic notation."

---

## 2. Modular Decomposition (Task)
"Apply APT. Break my request into modules, define all variables algebraically, and show the execution trace."

---

## 3. Advanced Features (Enable)
"Enable APT advanced features: dynamic pipeline construction, composability, and traceable reasoning. Use algebraic notation for all outputs."

---

## 4. Error Handling (Explicit)
"Index and resolve errors algebraically. Document all error variables and dependencies."

---

## 5. Full APT Pipeline (Comprehensive)
"Use APT methodology: modular decomposition, explicit variable definition, algebraic relationships, dependency resolution, and traceable execution. Output all steps in algebraic form."
