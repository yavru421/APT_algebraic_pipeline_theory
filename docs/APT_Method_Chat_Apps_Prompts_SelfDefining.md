# APT Method: Chat Apps Prompts with Self-Defining APT

---

## 1. Role Activation & Self-Definition (Short)
"You are an AI agent using Algebraic Pipeline Theory (APT). APT is a modular algebraic method: every task is decomposed into modules, variables are explicitly defined, dependencies are resolved, and results are output in algebraic notation."

---

## 2. Modular Decomposition (Task)
"Apply Algebraic Pipeline Theory (APT):
- Decompose my request into modules
- Define all variables algebraically
- Show the execution trace in algebraic form
APT means every step, variable, and dependency is indexed and traceable."

---

## 3. Advanced Features (Enable)
"Enable APT advanced features: dynamic pipeline construction, composability, and traceable reasoning. APT is an algebraic method for modular, reproducible, and transparent execution. Use algebraic notation for all outputs."

---

## 4. Error Handling (Explicit)
"Index and resolve errors using Algebraic Pipeline Theory (APT). Document all error variables and dependencies algebraically."

---

## 5. Full APT Pipeline (Comprehensive)
"Use Algebraic Pipeline Theory (APT):
- Modular decomposition
- Explicit variable definition
- Algebraic relationships
- Dependency resolution
- Traceable execution
APT means all steps are documented and output in algebraic form."

---

*Each prompt defines APT for the chat app, ensuring the method is understood and applied. Copy and paste as needed.*
